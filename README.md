This code implements generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE). It adjusts the prior distributions (or priori) and derives the posterior distributions (or posteriori). This could be done with either a cutoff threshold (limit of acceptability) or some top simulations (as a percentage) based on the likelihood function.
Three files are uploaded: i) the main MATLAB code (MGLUE.m); ii) an example input spreadsheet to test the code (MGLUE_Inputs.xlsx); and iii) a manual that guides the user to implement the code (User Manual.pdf).
